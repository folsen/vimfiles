`vim2hs :: Vim -> Haskell`
==========================

*"Vim to Haskell": A collection of vimscripts for Haskell development.*

Features
--------

* Written from scratch for clean and organized code, though some parts are
  borrowed from existing vimscripts.
* Highlights Haskell code in GitHub Flavored Markdown, and Literate Haskell
  documents as Markdown.
* Improved syntax highlighting including Haddock markup in comments,
  support for HSP and many quasi-quotes such as jmacro, shqq, regex, sql,
  string interpolation...
* Liberal syntax highlighting for Cabal package descriptions, yielding less
  false-positives for mistakes than other syntax files for Cabal.
* Makes Vim aware of Haskell modules and imports allowing you to `gf` with
  the cursor on a module to "go" to its source "file", etc.
* Support for using HLint both as a compiler and a command, integrated into
  the quickfix system in Vim.
* Unicode conceals for various operators and syntax, such as lambda and
  function composition.
* Integrates with third-party plugins, but doesn't require them:
  snippets for UltiSnips and patterns for Tabular.
* Posts buffers and line-ranges to [hpaste.org](http://hpaste.org).
* Highly configurable, most of the above can be disabled if it gets in the
  way.

Installation
------------

You need at least Vim 7.3, and for the HPaste command Python 2, not too
ancient.  Beyond that, just clone this repo and add it to your
`'runtimepath'`.  [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) is great for
automating that, [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) is also
popular.

See Also
--------

Here are some other Vimscripts that complement vim2hs nicely:

* Omni completion: [neco-ghc](https://github.com/ujihisa/neco-ghc)
* Syntax checking and linting: [syntastic](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic)
* Type inspection: [haskellmode](https://github.com/lukerandall/haskellmode-vim)
  or (better) [ghcmod](https://github.com/eagletmt/ghcmod-vim)
* Shakespeare templates highlighting: [html-template-syntax](https://github.com/pbrisbin/html-template-syntax)

Overview
--------

### Quasi Quoting

Haskell supports embedding arbitrary syntax that is processed at
compile-time.  Vim supports embedding external syntax highlighting.

These are all enabled by default but you can selectively opt out by adding
the relevant configuration overrides to your `~/.vimrc`:

```vim
let g:haskell_quasi         = 0
let g:haskell_interpolation = 0
let g:haskell_regex         = 0
let g:haskell_jmacro        = 0
let g:haskell_shqq          = 0
let g:haskell_sql           = 0
let g:haskell_json          = 0
let g:haskell_xml           = 0
```

### HSP

[Haskell Server Pages](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hsp) and
[Haskell Source with XML](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hsx)
pre-processes literal XML in Haskell source code into function application
and vim2hs provides limited support for this syntax - I have yet to figure
out how to highlight the body of XML elements differently while still
highlighting the attributes as Haskell.

This is enabled by default and can be disabled thusly:

```vim
let g:haskell_hsp = 0
```

### Haddock

Haddock generates API documentation from markup in the comments of Haskell
source files; vim2hs supports highlighting this markup distinctly.

This is currently disabled by default because it needs work. To enable it
try this:

```vim
let g:haskell_haddock = 1
```

### Markdown

It is common to mark up the Literate in Literate Haskell using Markdown,
and vim2hs substitutes the TeX-centric lhaskell filetype with a
Markdown-centric one.  TeX might be supported in the future.

GitHub's custom-flavored Markdown supports pygmented code blocks; vim2hs
extends your existing markdown filetype to highlight haskell in such
blocks.

There aren't yet any configuration options for these features.

### Strings

Haskell actually supports multi-line strings by escaping the newline, but I
don't think it's a widely used feature and I think quasi quoting is better
for such purposes.  Thus I have opted to keep string literals from crossing
lines so half your source file doesn't highlight as a string while you're
entering one, and instead, string literals without a matching end quote
highlight as errors.

The bottom half of this screenshot is just for filling the empty space and
tests that keywords are case sensitive - something many Vim syntax files
gets wrong.

![Strings and Keywords screenshot](https://github.com/dag/vim2hs/raw/master/screenshots/strings-and-keywords.png)

There are currently no configuration options for this, but I might add one
in the future if anyone is actually using the escaped newline syntax.

### HLint

HLint is provided as a compiler for Vim.

```vim
:compiler hlint
:make
```

As a convenience there's also a command that does the above and then resets
the compiler to its previous value.

```vim
:HLint
```

Either way any HLint suggestions and warnings will be put in Vim's quickfix
list and you can jump between them with `:cn` and `:cp`, although I
recommend setting up
[FuzzyFinder](https://github.com/vim-scripts/FuzzyFinder) and using its
`:FufQuickfix` command instead.

### HPaste

To pastebin the contents of the current buffer do this:

```vim
:HPaste
```

The newly created paste URL will be put in the `+` register, meaning your
normal desktop clipboard.

Alternatively, you can select a range of lines with Vim's VISUAL modes and
type the same as above, which should result in this:

```vim
:'<,'>HPaste
```

Which of course will paste the selected lines only.

If you get tired of entering your author name every time you can configure
it globally like so:

```vim
let g:hpaste_author = 'donri'
```

### UltiSnips

If you're using the excellent
[UltiSnips](https://github.com/sirver/ultisnips) Vimscript, vim2hs provides
some useful snippets for Haskell programming.  You can list all active
snippets by hitting `Ctrl+Tab` in INPUT mode.

### Tabular

Another useful Vimscript is
[Tabular](https://github.com/godlygeek/tabular).  If it's installed, vim2hs
adds some named patterns useful for maintaining layout in Haskell code.
You can list all named patterns by tab-completing after entering the
`:Tabularize` command.  You probably want to configure some mappings or
commands for the ones you find useful.

To disable them, use this configuration:

```vim
let g:haskell_tabular = 0
```
